The SPECCHIO Application consists of a Java application plus a number of library
files.

The SPECCHIO client and server binaries are also available as ZIP archives. 

Details about the operation of SPECCHIO can be found in the respective 
[User Guides](/guides/).

The SPECCHIO Virtualbox is a complete SPECCHIO server and client installed under
a virtual CentOS 7 installation using 
[Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

SPECCHIO users who want to run the full system locally, either on their personal

well.
